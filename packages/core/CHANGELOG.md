- [#3892](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3892) [`3c08778`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3c0877890500257fb19e9575d57399ec4bb159c9) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retain a live workflow VM across inline progress when sleeps are open or created at the same suspension boundary.

- [#3871](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3871) [`31dabce`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/31dabce0c87fa48af210362061324ff0369e094f) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Prefetch run encryption keys when reading workflow streams.

### Patch Changes

- [#3849](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3849) [`855e479`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/855e47990c0da35419325da27976bae925afb0e9) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix runs failing with `CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG` after every step had already succeeded, when the event log held two attribute writes under one id.

- [#3841](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3841) [`2668e33`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2668e3325ba89dec973c3c2f35c49efdb239de8d) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Make `resumeHook()` durable before it resolves: the `hook_received` event is
  written durably first, and the workflow wake is published only after the write
  is acknowledged. A disposal racing the queue delivery can no longer lose a
  resume the caller was told succeeded. The wake message is unchanged, so no
  consumer or backend coordination is needed; `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_LAZY_HOOK_RESUME`
  is now a no-op and the internal `resumeHookDurable()` alias is removed.

  Behavior changes: a resume against an ended run now throws `HookNotFoundError`
  instead of resolving (the lazy path never observed the server's rejection, so a
  late webhook delivery to a finished run answered 202 where it now answers 404).
  A transient write conflict (HTTP 409, e.g. an event-slot conflict under
  contention) is no longer re-keyed to `HookNotFoundError`: it surfaces as a
  retryable error, since its transaction committed nothing.

- [#3879](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3879) [`07ec212`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/07ec212fe762e0659d4528913716c59870fd6c7d) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Keep late-claimed buffered hook payloads from being preempted by workflow suspension in retained VMs.

- [#3797](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3797) [`1c28eec`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1c28eeca159f022c73912326baf78d69152db876) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Trace event loading, workflow VM creation, bundle compilation and evaluation, input hydration, and replay execution.

### Patch Changes

- [#3794](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3794) [`d9e0777`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d9e0777eb8b1ce5f3be3fe865bc5a17fdbdb9d5d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Keep the eager `hook_received` write for the internal resume that records a step-issued abort, so it stays committed before the step completes.

- [#3794](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3794) [`d9e0777`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d9e0777eb8b1ce5f3be3fe865bc5a17fdbdb9d5d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - `resumeHook()` no longer writes the `hook_received` event itself on the lazy path: the queue consumer creates it from the queue message, so a resume costs one round trip. A resume against an already-ended run now resolves instead of throwing `HookNotFoundError`.

- [#3609](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3609) [`82e2678`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/82e267893917e06f5d3ce316baefc27cd024a912) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retain workflow VMs across workflow attribute writes.

### Patch Changes

- [#3550](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3550) [`d62b444`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d62b44473b43e183e71386fe84b33f5e7bb5445c) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Keep schema-only World modules out of workflow VM bundles, prevent unknown attribute deletions from offsetting new keys, and safely ignore prototype-like event type names.

- [#3773](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3773) [`27cab14`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/27cab14adcc6f748500fca19cf78feeb60a125e7) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Send the disposed hook's token on `hook_disposed` from the QuickJS engine, matching the node:vm engine

- [#3490](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3490) [`f7fb012`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f7fb0126528fac2168492c3143fe0379b6f5ef1a) Thanks [@shalabhc](https://github.com/shalabhc)! - Report replay cost for every step-to-step transition, not just a run's first step, and flag whether a retained VM served the batch

- [#3682](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3682) [`5841558`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/584155897f75e712a1c2bc199d6d12027cd18dab) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fail the dev HMR e2e cleanup when a deleted workflow fixture is still imported by the generated step registrations, restoring the fixture so the dev server keeps serving the rest of the suite.

### Minor Changes

- [#3700](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3700) [`9b1b8c7`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9b1b8c711104fd507327aafc8cb965738f315e29) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Pin correlation-ID draw order to event-log order (Node.js VM engine), so two concurrent replays of the same run assign the same IDs even when one loaded a shorter event-log prefix. Set `WORKFLOW_LOG_ORDER_DRAWS=0` to opt back into arrival-order delivery resolution.

- [#3570](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3570) [`9454d51`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9454d51db0d52d6be9bafea9c70ab6fc3a1ceba4) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add `world.runs.waitForTerminalStatus(runId, { timeoutMs, signal, resolveData })` method, which long-polls until the run reaches a terminal status. `await run.returnValue` now internally uses this, if the World supports it, instead of using a polling interval.

- [#3634](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3634) [`7b79ba3`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7b79ba37cc97e858ceb8b2474e03bbc404b555a0) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - New runs are created with the sealed-log event identity (specVersion 7). A sealed-log run's event positions are assigned by the backend before each write commits, so concurrent writers never contend for a position. A position whose writer dies is closed by the backend with a `noop` event; replay steps over those without delivering them or advancing the deterministic clock. Set `WORKFLOW_SEALED_LOG=0` to put a deployment back on the previous scheme. Every runtime reads sealed logs either way, and a run's version is fixed at creation, so the setting only affects new runs.

### Patch Changes

- [#3675](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3675) [`5b5a926`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5b5a926f8850ec5d967e090cc0500028fd53e2ef) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Step-argument serialization failures now fail the step with a catchable `SerializationError` (via a `step_failed` event, like a step-body failure) instead of failing the run from outside the workflow, and when uncaught they fail the run immediately as a `USER_ERROR` rather than retrying until max queue deliveries.

- [#3728](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3728) [`f771585`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f771585486b3019c8d68211b158dfeffc9e5ebe8) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Hold process-wide state on `globalThis` rather than at module scope in the packages that get bundled into the host application's server build, where a bundler compiles one copy of each module per layer. Covers warn-once latches, lazy caches, the VM script and QuickJS asset caches, the dev-server port cache, and step single-flight, whose per-copy map was not actually single-flight. State that is deliberately per-copy is annotated with the reason.

- [#3728](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3728) [`f771585`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f771585486b3019c8d68211b158dfeffc9e5ebe8) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Build the workflow entrypoint's queue handler from the runtime World (`getWorld()`) instead of `getWorldHandlers()`, so a process creates one World rather than two. A stateful World no longer gets duplicate connection pools or queue workers.

- [#3743](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3743) [`bf9de1c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/bf9de1cd81eda1b1721b857364070c0ce70d1e58) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - A wait-continuation delivered before its wait elapses now re-arms under a fresh idempotency key instead of losing the wait's timer. Previously the re-enqueue reused a key the early delivery had already spent, so the world's dedupe window dropped it and the run slept indefinitely with nothing scheduled to wake it.

### Patch Changes

- [#3025](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3025) [`b0adb50`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b0adb50bce623b23252735021205e8d870a2b11f) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add `world.events.createBatch` World API method, which allows writing ordered events in one durable write, returning per-event outcomes. Optional. On by default if implemented by the World. Disable with `WORKFLOW_BATCH_TRANSITIONS=0`.

- [#3568](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3568) [`37e1d9e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/37e1d9e5a9870ef4a35e1875e7054253a9fb89c3) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Pre-claim inline steps inside the suspension batch, so a fan-out's inline step bodies start off the batch commit with no per-step claim request

- [#3497](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3497) [`1321570`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/13215704645ea487ef6f8821016ec3f13c1cd830) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Log ignored duplicate events at `debug` instead of `info`/`error`, so a straggler no longer prints on every replay of the run.

- [#3560](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3560) [`234d3dd`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/234d3dd7b852129e189d321314c4f749f12711d8) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Add a run-pickup watchdog to the e2e harness: a started run still pending after a budget is replaced (side-effect-free) and recorded as an infra event surfaced separately from test failures and flaky retries.

- [#3554](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3554) [`707dfe6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/707dfe6a063564cd1c146742e90661abc49534b3) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix a replay-determinism gap where branch wake order — and therefore step correlation ids — could depend on how much of the event log an invocation had loaded, corrupting runs under concurrent replays (CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG).

### Minor Changes

- [#3365](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3365) [`7683130`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7683130461a1a3de16c13be52d8aee96590b3814) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Resilient step dispatch: newly created steps are published to the queue in parallel with their `step_created` event write, with the serialized input carried on the message (`stepInput`) so the consumer re-ensures the event if the direct write failed transiently — mirroring resilient start (`runInput`) and resilient hook resume (`hookInput`). Worlds that enforce the precondition guard keep the sequential create-then-publish dispatch (only sequencing gives the message a happens-after edge over the create's guard verdict); step-dispatch idempotency keys are now step-identity-scoped. Disable via `WORKFLOW_RESILIENT_STEP_DISPATCH=0`.

### Patch Changes

- [#3462](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3462) [`9add9d7`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9add9d782d0cbf41ce447175c7b9fe47846d794d) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Reject compact sparse-array payloads with logical lengths above 100,000 during hydration.

A stale replay-context write no longer needs to be rejected: a reader holds a prefix of the log, replay is deterministic on a prefix, and the writer's next write reports the events it was pushed past.

- [#3381](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3381) [`efbc408`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/efbc408c4e98178dc8c8151764f308e9e4b6fd58) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Ignore duplicate events that a concurrent replay wrote for an entity the event log already records, instead of failing the run with a corrupted event log

### Patch Changes

- [#3385](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3385) [`74dbf81`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/74dbf81d327b8574cca429b56757c7322a26b4ef) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retry replay timeouts through normal queue redelivery instead of exiting the process, and keep Postgres jobs retryable through Core's terminal delivery limit.

- [#3124](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3124) [`65139ac`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/65139acfd7118d3b73672435a6e1c47115f6e23f) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Continue partial `run_started` event preloads from their cursor instead of reloading the event log from the beginning.

- [#3372](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3372) [`1a64f68`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1a64f684723757c5a839abb94189b953dd3ac536) Thanks [@ar-tama](https://github.com/ar-tama)! - Fix `Date` subclassing inside workflow functions. The deterministic `Date` override in the workflow VM now forwards `new.target` via `Reflect.construct`, so subclasses like `TZDate` from `@date-fns/tz` keep their identity, methods, and fields. Calling `Date()` without `new` now returns the (fixed) time string per spec, instead of a `Date` object.

- [#3382](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3382) [`a8db185`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a8db185c3b19b3dab971f51aa076aead81ed26ea) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fold new events returned by `events.create` into the replay log so a completed wait no longer needs a follow-up `events.list` round trip

- [#3286](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3286) [`4bb86d3`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4bb86d305423a2da813cbef8b7d6fe4421288bba) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Fail a workflow when its World deterministically rejects Hook creation.

- [#3374](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3374) [`439a495`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/439a495a715b9426ef4dbcf8d928a8fc50ffb040) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Carry the run's pinned deployment on lazy resume messages so misrouted deliveries re-route before the `hook_received` write.

- [#3342](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3342) [`eb9e13f`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/eb9e13fd23eb12e353cd8f53ed4357da06f8e5ac) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - QuickJS engine: start invocations by restoring a bundle-hydrated VM-memory snapshot instead of re-evaluating the workflow bundle (~25× faster VM startup; bundles with module-scope randomness or clock reads automatically fall back to fresh evaluation). Disable with `WORKFLOW_QUICKJS_BASELINE_SNAPSHOT=0`.

- [#3263](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3263) [`19b5b85`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/19b5b85c8b78cfd6c8ebbdf62ae7b8241a109595) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - QuickJS engine: move serialization out of the VM onto the host, replacing the in-VM serde bundle with side-effect-free handle introspection (same wire format, 2–100× faster).

- [#3406](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3406) [`fbebf71`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fbebf7104d97219b73b6a51b0e77e42c45cdd99c) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix replay divergence when a step result overtook an earlier sleep or hook delivery that was parked behind an unread hook's payload

- [#3389](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3389) [`6786db9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6786db99538ef57c872d861ecfb28d99ae857d6d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - **Breaking**: SpecVersion 6: Event IDs are now a dense per-run slot number, allocated by the world at publish time so a rejected write leaves no gap in the event log. A replay tells the world how many events it had read and gets back the ones it did not see, so an event that arrives from outside the replay and lands ahead of an event the replay wrote no longer fails the run with `CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG`: it is held for whichever part of the workflow awaits it. A gap in the numbering fails the run instead of being replayed over.

- [#3205](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3205) [`22349e9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/22349e95fd85a112cbec3f425900b74bf5ccc77f) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Load replay-event suffixes through one World request.

- [#3439](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3439) [`69c30ff`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/69c30ff49eb89c0c4c4b2642c37985fdf64fa9fd) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Stop reporting replay divergence for an event the workflow is still on its way to consuming, by waiting for in-flight step and hook deliveries instead of a fixed delay

- [#3124](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3124) [`65139ac`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/65139acfd7118d3b73672435a6e1c47115f6e23f) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Infer required run and step entities, including their start times, from

### Minor Changes

- [#3347](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3347) [`8d47928`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8d479283cabd9de84fa2542c4ff16f2697d16399) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add a bulk run cancellation primitive. `@workflow/world` defines the `BulkCancelWorkflowRuns*` contract and an optional `runs.cancelMany`; `@workflow/world-vercel` implements it via a single `POST /v4/runs/cancel`; `@workflow/core` adds a `cancelRuns` helper that uses `cancelMany` when available and falls back to bounded-concurrency single-run cancellation.

- [#3048](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3048) [`f8f6e17`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f8f6e17aebbd138e9c6c4a03814a5bfc65e63c23) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add an experimental QuickJS WASM VM engine for workflow execution, opt-in via `WORKFLOW_VM=quickjs` (or per-run `executionContext.workflowVm`). The engine performs the same full event replay as the default `node:vm` engine but runs workflow code in a QuickJS VM compiled to WebAssembly, enabling platforms without `node:vm` support and laying the groundwork for VM-memory snapshotting.

- [#3046](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3046) [`5d591d2`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5d591d28863b539d8ff5b5af56f99b43d1db9842) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retain workflow execution across inline steps within one invocation; `WORKFLOW_RETAINED_VM=0` disables retention. Boundaries whose step arguments are not primitive values fall back to ordinary replay.

- [#3047](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3047) [`89ede82`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/89ede82faa25143a150edcd088cd48b6d34daf3d) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retained workflow VMs now keep the fast path when step arguments are plain data or standard built-ins (`Map`, `Set`, `Date`, typed arrays, `URL`, `Headers`, …), not just primitives. A boundary falls back to a normal replay only when serializing its arguments ran code the workflow controls — a getter, a proxy, a custom serializer — or computed an `Error`'s stack trace.

### Patch Changes

- [#2960](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2960) [`79e4c04`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/79e4c044091185e68bbdcc254a86133e54956ad3) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Re-route a queue delivery that reaches a deployment other than the one its run is pinned to, retry transient publishing failures through normal queue redelivery, and fail the run with the new `DEPLOYMENT_MISMATCH` error code once the recovery budget is spent.

- [#3316](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3316) [`e084e08`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e084e08ac0b4f1830659cb316df50d50962aada4) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Allow configuring the polling interval used by `Run.returnValue` with `WORKFLOW_RETURN_VALUE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`.

- [#3345](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3345) [`9c1b3c8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9c1b3c86384181b673d41123d2eec0b987afc75a) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Initialize lazy hook resume replay from the `hook_received` write via the new advisory `preloadEvents` param, skipping `run_started` and the initial `events.list`; safe fallback otherwise.

- [#3301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3301) [`cb77725`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/cb77725960a8c280bd96fda0068fca0ba83d52f2) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add env option to split correlation ID derivation into per-entity-type sequential ULIDs, instead of sharing one derivation source

- [#3332](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3332) [`939ffb4`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/939ffb4f512a35d3fd041af16f3fa518552ba730) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Reject unsupported Hook retention synchronously inside QuickJS workflows.

- [#3319](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3319) [`27a3f15`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/27a3f15a7b08659f2b0e69e12e0c4ad923d7f4e5) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Preserve Hook minimum-retention deadlines in QuickJS workflows.

- [#3048](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3048) [`f8f6e17`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f8f6e17aebbd138e9c6c4a03814a5bfc65e63c23) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - QuickJS engine performance: cache compiled WebAssembly modules process-wide, and execute steps inline in a live-VM continuation loop (no queue round-trip per step, cheap events fed before step bodies, delayed wait-continuation dispatch for racing timers).

- [#3301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3301) [`cb77725`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/cb77725960a8c280bd96fda0068fca0ba83d52f2) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix stream IDs minted while serializing a step's arguments latching the host wall clock into a run's ID sequence, which gave every entity created afterwards a different correlation ID on each replay

- [#3360](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3360) [`72efc90`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/72efc90f286956e6cde25b814f9375a8ecbbff36) Thanks [@elliotdauber](https://github.com/elliotdauber)! - Derive inline-execution duration limits from `World.getRuntimeDeadline()` (implemented on Vercel World via `@vercel/functions`).

### Minor Changes

- [#3186](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3186) [`4a9d26b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4a9d26b1cb807a9e31489350b468db42a8c13ef3) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Record the compute instance that ran each step attempt: `CreateEventParams.computeInstanceId` is stamped on `step_started` writes, forwarded in the world-vercel v4 frame meta alongside `vercelId`, read back on `AnalyticsEvent` / `AnalyticsStep`, and surfaced as "Compute Instance ID" in the observability attribute panel.

- [#3244](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3244) [`ee944d2`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ee944d2476daca81b89ba545b522385a7902ec03) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Stamp the creating client's environment into the queue message's `runInput`, and refuse a queue delivery whose run was created in a different environment than the consuming deployment runs in, so one run ID can no longer be forked into two environments.

- [#3145](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3145) [`1471f25`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1471f252fa18024695f1bf149f5bee4876ab149e) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Strengthen the event-creation precondition guard: replay-context writes now also send the number of loaded events, so a snapshot that is missing an event is rejected instead of committing a divergent event log, and a rejection restarts the replay in-process (consuming the events a world may attach to the rejection) rather than re-committing the rejected payload or re-invoking over the queue. `@workflow/world-local` and `@workflow/world-postgres` do not implement the check.

- [#2989](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2989) [`9cc11f5`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9cc11f5329fbc9151c2f0ccd0139387c07f2d7ce) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Emit a `faas.instance` OTEL span attribute (a synthesized per-warm-instance id) on the flow and step route spans, so traces can distinguish which compute instance handled each request.

- [#3230](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3230) [`31f92df`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/31f92df10d295cf09c93aadd35380209c137326c) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Lazy hook resumption: on a fast path, `resumeHook()` writes the `hook_received` event and dispatches the workflow queue message concurrently instead of sequentially, cutting a round trip off resume latency. A `(runId, resumeId)` dedup constraint keeps the two writers converging on exactly one event; the runtime falls back to the sequential path when dedup support is unavailable or when `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_LAZY_HOOK_RESUME=1`. `resumeHook()` resolves to a `ResumedHook` (a `Hook` plus an optional `resilientResume: true` flag, set only when the direct write failed transiently and the resume was recovered via the queue consumer's re-ensure) — preserving the contract introduced alongside the resilient-resume work.

- [#1834](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1834) [`438eaa6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/438eaa6a595811e6d6942ba679e831d25e6cbfbe) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Make `resumeHook()` resilient to transient `hook_received` event write failures (429/5xx) by carrying the payload on the queue message for the runtime to materialize. Returned `Hook` gets a new `resilientResume: true` flag when this fallback path is taken.

A run with an outstanding `sleep()` replaying a batch of parallel step results could suspend inside that gap with none of the batch's follow-up work queued, going dormant until an unrelated timer fired.

### Major Changes

- [#3128](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3128) [`7959acc`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7959acc8cfadfafc8082086f3063a48448139573) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove the deprecated `experimental_setAttributes` and `ExperimentalSetAttributesOptions` aliases; use `setAttributes` and `SetAttributesOptions` instead.

- [#3112](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3112) [`4ada27d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4ada27d35af197d66196288919581d839f87c9a3) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Remove deprecated world-specific factory aliases in favor of `createWorld`.

- [#3061](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3061) [`62d570e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/62d570ed4bf38db333ae9fe9ba513c0d6a9d6b91) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Remove the retired step route runtime and make queue health checks target the combined flow handler.

- [#3045](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3045) [`d813fb8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d813fb8ee835c378db4428e1a9a7edb64cb0b494) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Deterministic sandbox hardening: `crypto.subtle.digest` in workflow functions now computes synchronously via `node:crypto` (byte-identical values, deterministic timing under replay); `Atomics.waitAsync`, async `WebAssembly` compilation, `WeakRef`, and `FinalizationRegistry` are no longer exposed (wall-clock timing and GC observation cannot be replayed).

### Minor Changes

- [#3098](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3098) [`8a95d36`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8a95d36c9a166351829f3c6382cddb68335b54d2) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Carry the owning run's public key in forwarded `WritableStream` descriptors, so a run writing into another run's stream seals frames with no run fetch and no key-API round trip.

- [#3146](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3146) [`e8bc7d6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e8bc7d6aadcdb5f89de1be71cfcafe5e9085ed25) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Let observability tooling decrypt sealed (`encp`) payloads: key resolution now yields the run's full key capability, and `hydrateDataWithKey` dispatches on the envelope format.

- [#3094](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3094) [`7a65030`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7a6503048acb72bd53e71197339de5cba312f834) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Teach the serialization layer to read and write `encp` sealed envelopes via a `PayloadKey` union, so a cross-run writer can encrypt with only a public key. Existing symmetric call sites are unaffected.

- [#3096](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3096) [`0b1ca15`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/0b1ca15dec3a4f56c32d33c5cf5add3ea208c54c) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - `resumeHook()` now seals its payload to the target run's published public key when one is present, removing the cross-deployment `run-key` API round trip from hook resumption. Readers resolve the full key capability so they can open sealed payloads.

- [#3095](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3095) [`b4ba79e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b4ba79ebc501248408474efdd6e353f1753d83e3) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Derive each run's X25519 public key at `start()` and stamp it on the run, so cross-run writers can seal payloads to the run without fetching its symmetric key.

- [#3093](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3093) [`4ba223a`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4ba223a01c56126aec5c982d3583f779ed96e8ca) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add the `encp` sealed-box encryption primitive: X25519 keypairs derived from the existing per-run key material, letting cross-run writers encrypt with only a public key. Not yet wired into any write path.

- [#3099](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3099) [`a86035f`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a86035f71f60e22170cae231cc6fb07e39928cc6) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - The cross-deployment capability probe now returns the target run's public key, letting `start()` seal workflow arguments without a separate key-lookup request.

### Patch Changes

- [#3111](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3111) [`8c12358`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8c12358075897ef1fdcc4ce3847579df63c8ca7a) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Clarify runtime invariants and compression behavior.

- [#3155](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3155) [`b8bcded`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b8bcded9d9e325f48a386ac70bad5eefee9d1664) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Seal forwarded writes to streams taken with `getWritable()` in a workflow body, which previously fell back to fetching the owner's symmetric key because the workflow VM has no key material to publish on the handle.

- [#3125](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3125) [`d24c91c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d24c91cfde678e9a4935ee94b9597b5696d6792b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Hooks can carry an optional `resumeContext`; when present, `resumeHook`/`resumeWebhook` resume from it directly instead of fetching the full run, saving a round trip per resume. When the context also carries the run's `encryptionPublicKey`, the resume seals its payload (`encp`) directly to that key, so a default webhook resume needs neither a run read nor a run-key lookup. These two optimizations fall back independently: it fetches the full run when the context is absent, and uses symmetric encryption when no usable public key is available.

- [#3069](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3069) [`fd05393`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fd05393d2b47d1a2f347538dd3b6062d808548d2) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Fix a false "exceeded max retries" run failure: the retry-ceiling guard counted duplicate `step_started` events written by invocations racing on the same pending batch as real attempts. The owned-recovery ceiling now counts only the owning message's own starts, and the background-step ceiling counts only bare (queue-delivered) starts.

- [#3088](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3088) [`fc81f45`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fc81f4502fa6d8d9a7a5c48b44394dc39c141a86) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Stream writes dispatch the first chunk of an idle stream immediately (flush window default 0 instead of 10ms). Fast producers keep full batching via in-flight accumulation; set `streamFlushIntervalMs` (World option) or `WORKFLOW_STREAM_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` (env, takes precedence) above 0 to opt into a windowed leading edge.

- [#3131](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3131) [`d7553c4`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d7553c4517b98c0eef37e5701fdfd316a7d5c008) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Avoid rescanning already prewarmed replay payloads during inline replays.

- [#3110](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3110) [`5d17c60`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5d17c609b109e77c055b70b7654dfa869e2ad0f1) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Consolidate runtime event merging logic.

- [#3139](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3139) [`2941b1c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2941b1c36048701b8aa8ae870482e54f1053ed33) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Deliver step results, wait completions, hook payloads and aborts in strict event-log order relative to one another, preventing replay divergence (`CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG`) when a step completion is adjacent in the log to a `wait_completed`, `hook_received` or abort that a concurrent branch is awaiting.

- [#3078](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3078) [`b610c46`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b610c46f8143afe3c862fb9957f5b4b48e754b42) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Stream write batching now lives in the server writable itself (group commit), so raw `ReadableStream`s piped across workflow/step boundaries batch the same as `getWritable()` instead of sending one request per chunk.

- [#2970](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2970) [`bb773e9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/bb773e950786b15100a8058407cbfcba23a44ebc) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Keep the inline event-log delta fast path active with open hooks when `WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD=1` and the World declares `capabilities.preconditionGuard`. The lazy inline `step_started` claim now carries the guard snapshot so a stale replay's claim is fenced (412 → fresh replay), and guard-enforced batches with an open hook take the await-then-run path so a fenced claim never executes the step body.

- [#2980](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2980) [`268fede`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/268fede627b3a83dbabcff9d35fd946132bf9a06) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Prepare encrypted replay payloads concurrently and cache the decrypted, decompressed representation for reuse across inline replay iterations.

The server writable now exposes a durable batch write that `flushablePipe` uses to coalesce chunks arriving while a previous write is in flight into a single `writeMulti`, while preserving the existing durability guarantees. Coalesced batches are split at chunk-count and byte wire limits (`WORKFLOW_STREAM_MAX_CHUNKS_PER_BATCH`, `WORKFLOW_STREAM_MAX_BYTES_PER_BATCH`), independent of the read-ahead backpressure bound (`WORKFLOW_STREAM_MAX_INFLIGHT_CHUNKS`).

## 5.0.0-beta.35

### Minor Changes

- [#2266](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2266) [`a00d169`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a00d16947085f8e94cf191c4d8850121cf201a94) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add an opt-in optimistic-concurrency guard for event creation (`WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD=1`): replay-context event creations send a `stateUpdatedAt` snapshot timestamp, and the runtime reloads the event log and retries (then falls back to a queue re-invocation) when the backend reports a newer out-of-band event with a 412 `PreconditionFailedError`.

- [#2929](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2929) [`1933e29`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1933e294cf938fb2314f45047033f8720ccf442b) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Report run-started-to-first-step (rsfs) and final-scheduling-replay (finalSchedulingReplay) latency telemetry on step completion events.

### Patch Changes

- [#2153](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2153) [`6b8efd5`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6b8efd58ce4829648f410e483bf42935dc5dcd1e) Thanks [@rchasman](https://github.com/rchasman)! - Record cross-run lineage when `start()` is called from inside a workflow or step: the new run is tagged with `$parentRunId` (its direct parent) and inherits the parent's `$rootRunId`, so a daisy chain or fan-out of any depth groups under one root id.

- [#2943](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2943) [`fd107b9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fd107b9c33db397b513ef134f458a1083bde7d98) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fixed TTFS latency telemetry reporting 0 for runs with region-tagged run IDs.

### Patch Changes

- [#2901](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2901) [`9242ddb`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9242ddb02c5df6046bf0d93cc5e520eedcfd7471) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Move client-observed stream telemetry to core: `chunk_rtt` on the flush span, `connect_ms` on the read span, and new `workflow.stream.close` and `workflow.stream.read.complete` spans. Dedupe `@opentelemetry/api` to one workspace instance.

### Minor Changes

- [#1981](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1981) [`9da2d76`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9da2d762604c2b73eb39f07fc0b069aea643e18d) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - `start()` now delegates run ID generation to `world.createRunId(options)` when the world provides it, falling back to a monotonic ULID otherwise. The full options bag is passed through so worlds can read whichever fields they recognise. Adds a new `region` option that worlds may consume — when set, it is also forwarded onto the queue options so the initial workflow message is routed to the matching region.

Log under `DEBUG=workflow:*` when `@opentelemetry/api` fails to load in world-vercel.

### Minor Changes

- [#2850](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2850) [`f28150c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f28150c62667f069dbe3c47e83102fef499ab92b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Report step progress alongside step-to-step overhead latency telemetry.

- [#2872](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2872) [`36c63af`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/36c63af4a88adc4f404decc54b1f2130d444d264) Thanks [@mitul-s](https://github.com/mitul-s)! - Record the source run on replays: `recreateRunFromExisting` now stamps `replayedFromRunId` into the new run's `executionContext` (and `start` accepts a matching option) so tooling can surface a run as a replay and link back to its origin.

### Patch Changes

- [#2790](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2790) [`145835b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/145835b6475f7fcc7e9983b2c7080f3433018ec9) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Centralize workflow event type classifiers and event-data payload field helpers.

- [#2687](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2687) [`9958424`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9958424f22903299e3fe556ab298bd3aaa45c6ac) Thanks [@Osamaali313](https://github.com/Osamaali313)! - Fix `extractStreamIds` overflowing the stack on circular references. The hydrated observability data it walks comes from devalue, which preserves circular and repeated references, so a step result containing a cycle would crash run inspection (`wf inspect` and the web dashboard) with a `RangeError`. The traversal now tracks visited containers and skips cycles.

- [#2848](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2848) [`6603628`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/66036282b5d18c9bef4dea4275782bc977842606) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix duplicate inline step execution when a hook or wait wakes a run while the step is still running (#2780). The lazy `step_started` now records the owning queue message ID, and wake replays schedule a delayed backstop for in-flight inline steps instead of immediately re-dispatching them. Disable with `WORKFLOW_INLINE_OWNERSHIP=0`.

- [#2874](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2874) [`48fcc4e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/48fcc4efcc7e6c639c51ce4f8971d4d3b1ebdd23) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add a `namespace` option to `start()`, `recreateRunFromExisting()`, `reenqueueRun()`, and `wakeUpRun()` for targeting deployments with namespaced queue topics, and make `healthCheck()` respect its timeout when the stream read hangs.

- [#2857](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2857) [`2c6ee61`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2c6ee614b50d12ed850e7589cf296150b2143a56) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add stream latency to OTEL spans

## 5.0.0-beta.21

### Minor Changes

- [#2526](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2526) [`3e82a12`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3e82a12712b1efe229ac2b1623dc6c8fc7be7055) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add turbo mode (on by default, disable with `WORKFLOW_TURBO=0`): on the first delivery of a run's first invocation the runtime backgrounds `run_started`, skips the initial event-log load, and forces optimistic inline start so the run reaches its first steps with no preceding network round-trips. It is safe there because the first delivery has no concurrent handler to race; turbo mode deactivates once a hook or sleep is encountered.

### Patch Changes

- [#2412](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2412) [`6de5ea5`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6de5ea5c2f32b474274f5dabe5f3663e03622ac5) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix a race where an `AbortController` aborted from a step was not reflected in a `controller.signal` passed to a subsequent step. The step now commits the abort's durable hook event before completing, and the workflow's suspension waits for the abort to land before serializing downstream step arguments.

- [#2472](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2472) [`66ca0dc`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/66ca0dcc096440f39dd234e04669e1fc7bf2d615) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Memoize hydrated step return values across inline replay iterations, turning the per-invocation step-result decrypt+parse cost from O(N²) to O(N) for sequential workflows. Only primitive results are cached, so deterministic replay is preserved.

## 5.0.0-beta.20

### Minor Changes

- [#2525](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2525) [`7aee0d4`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7aee0d4e4aae627d900068a4740fd69e651d1a2f) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Derive the workflow VM's deterministic RNG seed from `runId:workflowName:deploymentId` (instead of including the run's `startedAt`) and its initial fixed clock from the ULID timestamp embedded in `runId`. These inputs are all available the moment a queue message arrives, decoupling VM setup from the `run_started` round-trip. Note: this changes the seed-derived value sequence (step/hook correlation IDs, nanoids, random values) for a given run, so runs started before this change must not be replayed across the upgrade.

- [#2516](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2516) [`84ccd40`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/84ccd40ea3e12ba6b67967a4ff9f0b84b2393c48) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Inline execution now runs up to `WORKFLOW_MAX_INLINE_STEPS` (default 3) steps in parallel per suspension, each lazily created. An opt-in `WORKFLOW_OPTIMISTIC_INLINE_START` (default off) additionally starts step bodies before `step_started` is confirmed, reconciling the in-flight start before the terminal write so a lost create-claim is discarded; it is off by default because under contention a step body can run more than once (e.g. two runs writing to the workflow stream can corrupt it), so only enable it for idempotent steps.

### Patch Changes

- [#2473](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2473) [`16b3670`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/16b36703e2b1102df33bb301e8b19d7031dbb70f) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Drain consecutively consumable replay events in a single synchronous pass instead of one `process.nextTick` per event, removing O(N) macrotask hops from replay.

- [#2475](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2475) [`2074f91`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2074f91b86c43267549625fd89f597c7bedf44ca) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Skip the per-step incremental `events.list` round-trip in the inline sequential loop by consuming an event-log delta returned from the step's terminal write (gated to the single-step case with no open hooks or waits).

  Add the opt-in `CreateEventParams.sinceCursor` contract so a step-terminal `events.create` can return the event-log delta since that cursor (via `EventResult.events`/`cursor`/`hasMore`).

  Return the inline delta from a step-terminal write when `sinceCursor` is supplied, computed identically to `events.list` so the consumed prefix cannot skew from the server log.

  Forward `sinceCursor` over the v4 wire in `@workflow/world-vercel` so the server can return the delta on a step-terminal response; older servers ignore it and the runtime falls back to `events.list`.

- [#2478](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2478) [`e7ef9d8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e7ef9d823bd6c962d9c0c62e50e4883848c270f9) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Lazy inline step start: the owned-inline runtime path now sends a single `step_started` carrying the step input, letting the world create the step on the fly and saving one round-trip per inline step.

  `@workflow/world`: `step_started` event data accepts an optional `input`, and `EventResult` gains a `stepCreated` ownership signal.

  `@workflow/world-local`: `step_started` with input atomically creates the step plus a synthetic `step_created` event; a lazy `step_started` for an already-existing step throws `EntityConflictError` so concurrent losers skip (exactly-once).

  `@workflow/world-postgres`: same lazy-create + exactly-once create-claim for the Postgres backend.

  `@workflow/world-vercel`: sends the step input on `step_started` over the v4 wire and threads the server's `stepCreated` signal into `EventResult`.

- [#2522](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2522) [`722bb7c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/722bb7c6a20a7f255757280739d8b51661ed7792) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Cache the local dev server port per process so workflow replays no longer re-run OS port discovery (which spawns `lsof` on macOS, ~60ms) on every replay.

- [#2527](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2527) [`de91f20`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/de91f20f6828904a2da1d80c9f6ae729438a453b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Refine `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE=linked` (the default) so each queue-delivered `workflow.execute` / `step.execute` span nests under its local delivery context instead of starting a new trace root.

- [#2511](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2511) [`ab2e9b8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ab2e9b8d0740c457f80e05f05c1fd907bcf4f027) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Emit `workflowName` on per-step events (`step_created`, `step_completed`, and lazy-start `step_started`) so Worlds can access it without additional queries

Omit the option (or pass `undefined`) to get a randomly generated token, or pass a non-empty string.

- [#2529](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2529) [`37312ed`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/37312edd0a9ae973113c9ef8d5fe6a25b603063a) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Speed up workflow stack-trace remapping when source maps are absent (production default): skip bundle scanning when no frame references the workflow file and memoize parsed source maps per bundle.

Reads dispatch on the prefix, so both codecs are always decodable. Compression is applied before encryption, gated on run specVersion 5, and skipped for small or incompressible payloads. `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_COMPRESSION=1` disables writes; `WORKFLOW_COMPRESSION_CODEC=gzip` forces the portable codec.

### Patch Changes

- [#2394](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2394) [`5f0b845`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f0b845211152b6f2860c78d0dd4dccc9d4f0d97) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Emit OpenTelemetry span attributes for payload compression on the serialize (write) and deserialize (read) paths: `workflow.serialization.{operation,compressed,uncompressed_bytes,stored_bytes,compression_ratio}`. Sizes are measured at the compression boundary (pre-encryption). Telemetry failures never affect serialization.

- [#2397](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2397) [`4b7a720`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4b7a7203bf7093a435a9c4fc33a3af1060f010f7) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - `start({ deploymentId: 'latest' })` is now a no-op in Worlds that don't support atomic deployments (local dev, Postgres) instead of throwing — it logs a warning and targets the current deployment, so workflows that use `'latest'` on Vercel still run locally.

- [#2470](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2470) [`3c79c56`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3c79c56af257b4c327e4363c0cdb482149b55c73) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Fix the payload-compression capability cutoff: gzip/zstd are gated on `5.0.0-beta.18` (the first published version containing the compression read path) instead of `5.0.0-beta.16`. The previous cutoff would let a producer write compressed payloads to a beta.16/beta.17 target that cannot decode them.

### Minor Changes

- [#2363](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2363) [`926a5e7`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/926a5e7c6a50c1e74f2e2cc37324caa0f6442d85) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE` with a new `linked` default: each workflow/step invocation span is now its own trace root with span links to the delivery and run-origin contexts, instead of one trace spanning the entire run. world-vercel now explicitly injects W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate`/`baggage` headers on outgoing workflow-server requests.

  Span names are also friendlier: workflow and step spans now use the short function name (e.g. `workflow.execute processOrder`, `step.execute chargeCard`, `workflow.start processOrder`) instead of the uppercase prefixes and full machine names (`WORKFLOW_V2 workflow//./src/jobs/order//processOrder`). The full name remains available in the `workflow.name` / `step.name` span attributes, and new `workflowDisplayName` / `stepDisplayName` helpers are exported from `@workflow/utils`.

  Behavioral changes to telemetry under the new default (set `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE=continuous` to restore the previous trace shape exactly; the span-name change applies in both modes):
  - A run no longer shares one trace ID: the trace of the request that called `start()` no longer contains the workflow's execution spans — navigate via span links or the `workflow.run.id` attribute instead.
  - Sampling decisions are made independently per invocation root (previously one parent-based decision covered the whole run), and the number of root spans/traces increases to one per invocation.
  - `workflow.execute`/`step.execute` invocation spans (formerly `WORKFLOW_V2`/`STEP`) become parentless roots, which changes parent/child-based queries and service-map edges.
  - Re-enqueued queue messages forward the original run-origin trace carrier unchanged, rather than each invocation's current context.
  - Queries or dashboards matching the old `WORKFLOW_V2 ...`/`STEP ...` span names must switch to the new names.
  - The queue-delivered `workflow.execute` span kind changed from `internal` to `consumer`, matching the queue-delivered `step.execute` span (this applies in both modes).

  Existing attributes and baggage keys are unchanged, and everything remains a no-op when no OpenTelemetry SDK is registered.

The framing decision is gated on a new `framedByteStreams` capability and recorded per-stream in the serialized ref (`framing: 'framed-v1'`); legacy raw streams continue to work unchanged.

The runtime now queues every pending operation (non-inline steps + wait timer) in one `Promise.all` and then inline-executes one owned step (if any). The asymmetric `{ timeoutSeconds }` return contract for waits is dropped from suspension processing; waits become normal queue continuations with `delaySeconds`, deduplicated per wait so repeated suspension passes don't accumulate delayed messages. Continuation delays are clamped to 23h (VQS's message-retention bound) with longer waits chained across hop-keyed messages, so multi-day `sleep()`s work on every world. This restores inline step execution for `Promise.race(step, sleep)` workflows without any of the carve-outs the prior fix needed: even when the inline step blocks the handler, the wait continuation fires in parallel and drives the next replay. As part of the same change, `world-local`'s queue now honors `delaySeconds` (matches `world-vercel` / `world-postgres`), and its `close()` aborts pending delayed deliveries and retry sleeps so dev-server/test shutdown isn't held open by wait timers.

- [#1854](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1854) [`8d75491`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8d75491a074991dac3c7cf56823feb15354ab0f1) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Surface `workflowCoreVersion` from the responding deployment in `healthCheck()` results.

### Patch Changes

- [#2185](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2185) [`0fd0891`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/0fd0891cc4acab6d84610d3603f3cb90a33f29b0) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix `CorruptedEventLogError` on replay when a workflow races a hook read against a `sleep()` (e.g. `Promise.race([hook, sleep])`). Branch-deciding deliveries (buffered hook payloads and wait completions) are now handed to the workflow in strict event-log order — anchored on event position rather than on microtask-resolution timing — so the committed branch wins the race deterministically, independent of decryption/hydration time or `Promise.race` argument order.

- [#2257](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2257) [`ccd37e9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ccd37e9a59f1b3629815cdaf1c650610c709a580) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Avoid unhandled run lookups for unused or empty readable streams and include Vercel request correlation headers in world transport errors.

### Patch Changes

- [#2038](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2038) [`dc0be50`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/dc0be50618bd6a465e3f9768ee7427d282aa1fd7) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Refresh workflow events after completing elapsed waits so concurrent hook events preserve deterministic replay order.

Long-running steps no longer hit `REPLAY_TIMEOUT` (fixes #2009). Adds a `WORKFLOW_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_MS` env var override and a new optional `World.processExitTriggersQueueRedelivery` capability used to gate the runtime's `process.exit(1)` failure path.

### Major Changes

- [#1851](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1851) [`5f22832`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f228326757f7da349edfed89845bd109c98f104) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Run and step errors are now serialized through the workflow serialization pipeline, preserving original class identity and cause chains on `WorkflowRunFailedError.cause`. Pre-upgrade failed runs in the `world-postgres` legacy `error` text column surface as `error: undefined` on read; the original payload is still readable directly from the `errorJson` column for manual inspection.

### Minor Changes

- [#1511](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1511) [`e7ea068`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e7ea0684f44b3743dbc56543ea103786ab7144bc) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add first-class serialization support for built-in Error subclasses (`TypeError`, `RangeError`, `SyntaxError`, `URIError`, `ReferenceError`, `EvalError`, `AggregateError`) and preserve the `cause` property on all Error types

- [#1513](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1513) [`74b13cd`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/74b13cd3ed3412d4e99af55587c69dc458fa5400) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add first-class serialization for `FatalError` and `RetryableError` so they round-trip with class identity preserved across all serialization boundaries (including from environments that don't run the SWC plugin)

### Patch Changes

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Drain pending queue items at workflow completion instead of only logging warnings, and implicitly dispose any never-aborted system (abort) hooks at completion so unused `AbortController` instances don't leave abandoned rows in the hooks table for the run's TTL

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Fix `DOMException` not serializing correctly

- [#1849](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1849) [`1203dae`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1203dae70c802eef114909e9476e19ec528550cd) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Friendlier workflow error messages. New `SerializationError`, `WorkflowBuildError`, and structured context-violation classes (e.g. `NotInWorkflowContextError`) with actionable hints and docs links applied to user-facing throw sites; `FatalError.is()` recognizes any error with `fatal: true` so context violations and serialization failures now fail fast instead of burning retry attempts. Runtime logs are namespaced under `[workflow-sdk]` and gain `errorAttribution` (`user` vs `sdk`) plus class-aware hints

- [#1747](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1747) [`00a011d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/00a011dee43b3ba7c399a97b9ed072cf4ce66816) Thanks [@ijjk](https://github.com/ijjk)! - Fix eager Next.js workflow builds with lazy discovery disabled.

The runtime logger uses color-coded metadata blocks.

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add serializable `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` support across workflow and step boundaries. Workflow code can now construct an `AbortController`, pass `signal` to steps, and call `abort()`.

  **Behavior change:** `AbortError` thrown from inside a step is now wrapped as `FatalError` and skips retry semantics. As a result, custom timeouts on `fetch` inside steps are no longer re-tried by default, and now need to be wrapped in `RetryableError` to preserve the old behavior.

- [#1299](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1299) [`9f3516e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9f3516ec28f15d8bb5bfa9ee57aed858301fa4fd) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Refactor `serialization.ts` into modular `serialization/` files. No runtime change.

- [#1935](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1935) [`d0e3f27`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d0e3f2722b744472a90e48062e3876040e21de82) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Preserve the `this` binding of bound step proxies across workflow serialization, so passing `useStep(...).bind(thisArg)` as a step argument no longer loses the receiver.

  This is part of specVersion 2 changes where serialization of workflow and step data uses binary format instead of JSON arrays. This allows the workflow client to be fully responsible for the data serialization format and enables future enhancements such as encryption and compression without the World implementation needing to care about the underlying data representation.

## 4.0.1-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- 5eb588a: Remove step function identifier transform out of swc-plugin and into `useStep()` runtime function
- 00b0bb9: Implement the world's structured error interface
- 85ce8e0: add waitUntil wrapping for toplevel commands for transaction-like behavior

  when deployed on Vercel or other serverless providers, we must signal that we need to wait until operations are done before the function can halt the request.

  This means that we can't rely on discrete operations (like Queue.queue or Storage calls), and instead wrap the entire `start` function (which calls multiple discrete operations) in a single `await waitUntil` call.

## 4.0.1-beta.10

### Patch Changes
