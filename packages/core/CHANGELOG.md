# @workflow/core

## 5.0.0-beta.21

### Minor Changes

- [#2526](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2526) [`3e82a12`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3e82a12712b1efe229ac2b1623dc6c8fc7be7055) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add turbo mode (on by default, disable with `WORKFLOW_TURBO=0`): on the first delivery of a run's first invocation the runtime backgrounds `run_started`, skips the initial event-log load, and forces optimistic inline start so the run reaches its first steps with no preceding network round-trips. It is safe there because the first delivery has no concurrent handler to race; turbo mode deactivates once a hook or sleep is encountered.

### Patch Changes

- [#2412](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2412) [`6de5ea5`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6de5ea5c2f32b474274f5dabe5f3663e03622ac5) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix a race where an `AbortController` aborted from a step was not reflected in a `controller.signal` passed to a subsequent step. The step now commits the abort's durable hook event before completing, and the workflow's suspension waits for the abort to land before serializing downstream step arguments.

- [#2472](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2472) [`66ca0dc`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/66ca0dcc096440f39dd234e04669e1fc7bf2d615) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Memoize hydrated step return values across inline replay iterations, turning the per-invocation step-result decrypt+parse cost from O(N²) to O(N) for sequential workflows. Only primitive results are cached, so deterministic replay is preserved.

## 5.0.0-beta.20

### Minor Changes

- [#2525](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2525) [`7aee0d4`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7aee0d4e4aae627d900068a4740fd69e651d1a2f) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Derive the workflow VM's deterministic RNG seed from `runId:workflowName:deploymentId` (instead of including the run's `startedAt`) and its initial fixed clock from the ULID timestamp embedded in `runId`. These inputs are all available the moment a queue message arrives, decoupling VM setup from the `run_started` round-trip. Note: this changes the seed-derived value sequence (step/hook correlation IDs, nanoids, random values) for a given run, so runs started before this change must not be replayed across the upgrade.

- [#2516](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2516) [`84ccd40`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/84ccd40ea3e12ba6b67967a4ff9f0b84b2393c48) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Inline execution now runs up to `WORKFLOW_MAX_INLINE_STEPS` (default 3) steps in parallel per suspension, each lazily created. An opt-in `WORKFLOW_OPTIMISTIC_INLINE_START` (default off) additionally starts step bodies before `step_started` is confirmed, reconciling the in-flight start before the terminal write so a lost create-claim is discarded; it is off by default because under contention a step body can run more than once (e.g. two runs writing to the workflow stream can corrupt it), so only enable it for idempotent steps.

### Patch Changes

- [#2473](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2473) [`16b3670`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/16b36703e2b1102df33bb301e8b19d7031dbb70f) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Drain consecutively consumable replay events in a single synchronous pass instead of one `process.nextTick` per event, removing O(N) macrotask hops from replay.

- [#2475](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2475) [`2074f91`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2074f91b86c43267549625fd89f597c7bedf44ca) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Skip the per-step incremental `events.list` round-trip in the inline sequential loop by consuming an event-log delta returned from the step's terminal write (gated to the single-step case with no open hooks or waits).

  Add the opt-in `CreateEventParams.sinceCursor` contract so a step-terminal `events.create` can return the event-log delta since that cursor (via `EventResult.events`/`cursor`/`hasMore`).

  Return the inline delta from a step-terminal write when `sinceCursor` is supplied, computed identically to `events.list` so the consumed prefix cannot skew from the server log.

  Forward `sinceCursor` over the v4 wire in `@workflow/world-vercel` so the server can return the delta on a step-terminal response; older servers ignore it and the runtime falls back to `events.list`.

- [#2478](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2478) [`e7ef9d8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e7ef9d823bd6c962d9c0c62e50e4883848c270f9) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Lazy inline step start: the owned-inline runtime path now sends a single `step_started` carrying the step input, letting the world create the step on the fly and saving one round-trip per inline step.

  `@workflow/world`: `step_started` event data accepts an optional `input`, and `EventResult` gains a `stepCreated` ownership signal.

  `@workflow/world-local`: `step_started` with input atomically creates the step plus a synthetic `step_created` event; a lazy `step_started` for an already-existing step throws `EntityConflictError` so concurrent losers skip (exactly-once).

  `@workflow/world-postgres`: same lazy-create + exactly-once create-claim for the Postgres backend.

  `@workflow/world-vercel`: sends the step input on `step_started` over the v4 wire and threads the server's `stepCreated` signal into `EventResult`.

- [#2522](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2522) [`722bb7c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/722bb7c6a20a7f255757280739d8b51661ed7792) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Cache the local dev server port per process so workflow replays no longer re-run OS port discovery (which spawns `lsof` on macOS, ~60ms) on every replay.

- [#2527](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2527) [`de91f20`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/de91f20f6828904a2da1d80c9f6ae729438a453b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Refine `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE=linked` (the default) so each queue-delivered `workflow.execute` / `step.execute` span nests under its local delivery context instead of starting a new trace root.

- [#2511](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2511) [`ab2e9b8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ab2e9b8d0740c457f80e05f05c1fd907bcf4f027) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Emit `workflowName` on per-step events (`step_created`, `step_completed`, and lazy-start `step_started`) so Worlds can access it without additional queries

- [#2471](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2471) [`939890d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/939890d4c2998823d95732dbc310712709618bc9) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Cache the compiled workflow-bundle `vm.Script` per process so replays reuse the compiled bundle instead of re-parsing it on every iteration.

- [#2490](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2490) [`a92c16d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a92c16debd46f3804b01682eadfbfc355f03921c) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Reject an explicit empty-string `token` in `createHook()`. Omit the option (or pass `undefined`) to get a randomly generated token, or pass a non-empty string.

- [#2529](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2529) [`37312ed`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/37312edd0a9ae973113c9ef8d5fe6a25b603063a) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Speed up workflow stack-trace remapping when source maps are absent (production default): skip bundle scanning when no frame references the workflow file and memoize parsed source maps per bundle.

### Minor Changes

- [#2394](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2394) [`5f0b845`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f0b845211152b6f2860c78d0dd4dccc9d4f0d97) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Compress serialized payloads (step inputs/outputs, workflow arguments/return values, errors, hook payloads) before storage using composable codec format prefixes. zstd is the preferred codec (markedly faster than gzip at an equal-or-better ratio, via `node:zlib`); gzip (`CompressionStream`) is the portable fallback when zstd is unavailable. Reads dispatch on the prefix, so both codecs are always decodable. Compression is applied before encryption, gated on run specVersion 5, and skipped for small or incompressible payloads. `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_COMPRESSION=1` disables writes; `WORKFLOW_COMPRESSION_CODEC=gzip` forces the portable codec.

### Patch Changes

- [#2394](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2394) [`5f0b845`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f0b845211152b6f2860c78d0dd4dccc9d4f0d97) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Emit OpenTelemetry span attributes for payload compression on the serialize (write) and deserialize (read) paths: `workflow.serialization.{operation,compressed,uncompressed_bytes,stored_bytes,compression_ratio}`. Sizes are measured at the compression boundary (pre-encryption). Telemetry failures never affect serialization.

- [#2397](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2397) [`4b7a720`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4b7a7203bf7093a435a9c4fc33a3af1060f010f7) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - `start({ deploymentId: 'latest' })` is now a no-op in Worlds that don't support atomic deployments (local dev, Postgres) instead of throwing — it logs a warning and targets the current deployment, so workflows that use `'latest'` on Vercel still run locally.

- [#2470](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2470) [`3c79c56`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3c79c56af257b4c327e4363c0cdb482149b55c73) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Fix the payload-compression capability cutoff: gzip/zstd are gated on `5.0.0-beta.18` (the first published version containing the compression read path) instead of `5.0.0-beta.16`. The previous cutoff would let a producer write compressed payloads to a beta.16/beta.17 target that cannot decode them.

### Minor Changes

- [#2363](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2363) [`926a5e7`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/926a5e7c6a50c1e74f2e2cc37324caa0f6442d85) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE` with a new `linked` default: each workflow/step invocation span is now its own trace root with span links to the delivery and run-origin contexts, instead of one trace spanning the entire run. world-vercel now explicitly injects W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate`/`baggage` headers on outgoing workflow-server requests.

  Span names are also friendlier: workflow and step spans now use the short function name (e.g. `workflow.execute processOrder`, `step.execute chargeCard`, `workflow.start processOrder`) instead of the uppercase prefixes and full machine names (`WORKFLOW_V2 workflow//./src/jobs/order//processOrder`). The full name remains available in the `workflow.name` / `step.name` span attributes, and new `workflowDisplayName` / `stepDisplayName` helpers are exported from `@workflow/utils`.

  Behavioral changes to telemetry under the new default (set `WORKFLOW_TRACE_MODE=continuous` to restore the previous trace shape exactly; the span-name change applies in both modes):
  - A run no longer shares one trace ID: the trace of the request that called `start()` no longer contains the workflow's execution spans — navigate via span links or the `workflow.run.id` attribute instead.
  - Sampling decisions are made independently per invocation root (previously one parent-based decision covered the whole run), and the number of root spans/traces increases to one per invocation.
  - `workflow.execute`/`step.execute` invocation spans (formerly `WORKFLOW_V2`/`STEP`) become parentless roots, which changes parent/child-based queries and service-map edges.
  - Re-enqueued queue messages forward the original run-origin trace carrier unchanged, rather than each invocation's current context.
  - Queries or dashboards matching the old `WORKFLOW_V2 ...`/`STEP ...` span names must switch to the new names.
  - The queue-delivered `workflow.execute` span kind changed from `internal` to `consumer`, matching the queue-delivered `step.execute` span (this applies in both modes).

  Existing attributes and baggage keys are unchanged, and everything remains a no-op when no OpenTelemetry SDK is registered.

The flag is carried through the resilient-start queue input so lazy run creation validates identically.

The framing decision is gated on a new `framedByteStreams` capability and recorded per-stream in the serialized ref (`framing: 'framed-v1'`); legacy raw streams continue to work unchanged.

- [#2373](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2373) [`01c8c08`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/01c8c0878a515bec4476ee2bc90b26d914822632) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Replace `hook.hasConflict` (a `Promise<boolean>` property) with `hook.getConflict()`, a method returning a promise that suspends the workflow to commit hook registration and resolves with the conflicting `Run` when another active hook owns the token (or `null` once the hook is registered), without waiting for hook payload data. Code using `await hook.hasConflict` should migrate to `const conflict = await hook.getConflict()` and branch on `conflict !== null`.

- [#2226](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2226) [`ae8d6fe`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ae8d6feeda0d1d31da8da70156d6e04ebb0487d0) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Allow passing initial run attributes through `start()`, and speed up workflow-level `setAttribute` calls by using native events for recording attributes.

### Patch Changes

- [#1925](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1925) [`b3279f8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b3279f8b17ca5a57a364d12b5e9394f7d27fe3b2) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - V2 suspension processing: unify wait + step queue dispatch into a single parallel batch. The runtime now queues every pending operation (non-inline steps + wait timer) in one `Promise.all` and then inline-executes one owned step (if any). The asymmetric `{ timeoutSeconds }` return contract for waits is dropped from suspension processing; waits become normal queue continuations with `delaySeconds`, deduplicated per wait so repeated suspension passes don't accumulate delayed messages. Continuation delays are clamped to 23h (VQS's message-retention bound) with longer waits chained across hop-keyed messages, so multi-day `sleep()`s work on every world. This restores inline step execution for `Promise.race(step, sleep)` workflows without any of the carve-outs the prior fix needed: even when the inline step blocks the handler, the wait continuation fires in parallel and drives the next replay. As part of the same change, `world-local`'s queue now honors `delaySeconds` (matches `world-vercel` / `world-postgres`), and its `close()` aborts pending delayed deliveries and retry sleeps so dev-server/test shutdown isn't held open by wait timers.

Branch-deciding deliveries (buffered hook payloads and wait completions) are now handed to the workflow in strict event-log order — anchored on event position rather than on microtask-resolution timing — so the committed branch wins the race deterministically, independent of decryption/hydration time or `Promise.race` argument order.

Long-running steps no longer hit `REPLAY_TIMEOUT` (fixes #2009).

### Major Changes

- [#1851](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1851) [`5f22832`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f228326757f7da349edfed89845bd109c98f104) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Run and step errors are now serialized through the workflow serialization pipeline, preserving original class identity and cause chains on `WorkflowRunFailedError.cause`. Pre-upgrade failed runs in the `world-postgres` legacy `error` text column surface as `error: undefined` on read; the original payload is still readable directly from the `errorJson` column for manual inspection.

### Minor Changes

- [#1511](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1511) [`e7ea068`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e7ea0684f44b3743dbc56543ea103786ab7144bc) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add first-class serialization support for built-in Error subclasses (`TypeError`, `RangeError`, `SyntaxError`, `URIError`, `ReferenceError`, `EvalError`, `AggregateError`) and preserve the `cause` property on all Error types

- [#1513](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1513) [`74b13cd`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/74b13cd3ed3412d4e99af55587c69dc458fa5400) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add first-class serialization for `FatalError` and `RetryableError` so they round-trip with class identity preserved across all serialization boundaries (including from environments that don't run the SWC plugin)

### Patch Changes

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Drain pending queue items at workflow completion instead of only logging warnings, and implicitly dispose any never-aborted system (abort) hooks at completion so unused `AbortController` instances don't leave abandoned rows in the hooks table for the run's TTL

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Fix `DOMException` not serializing correctly

- [#1849](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1849) [`1203dae`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1203dae70c802eef114909e9476e19ec528550cd) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Friendlier workflow error messages. New `SerializationError`, `WorkflowBuildError`, and structured context-violation classes (e.g. `NotInWorkflowContextError`) with actionable hints and docs links applied to user-facing throw sites; `FatalError.is()` recognizes any error with `fatal: true` so context violations and serialization failures now fail fast instead of burning retry attempts. Runtime logs are namespaced under `[workflow-sdk]` and gain `errorAttribution` (`user` vs `sdk`) plus class-aware hints

- [#1747](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1747) [`00a011d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/00a011dee43b3ba7c399a97b9ed072cf4ce66816) Thanks [@ijjk](https://github.com/ijjk)! - Fix eager Next.js workflow builds with lazy discovery disabled.

The runtime logger uses color-coded metadata blocks.

- [#1301](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1301) [`aee5699`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/aee56993c777e6fc8d40af8d90ec3d4fbd86cdfe) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add serializable `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` support across workflow and step boundaries. Workflow code can now construct an `AbortController`, pass `signal` to steps, and call `abort()`.

  **Behavior change:** `AbortError` thrown from inside a step is now wrapped as `FatalError` and skips retry semantics. As a result, custom timeouts on `fetch` inside steps are no longer re-tried by default, and now need to be wrapped in `RetryableError` to preserve the old behavior.

- [#1299](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1299) [`9f3516e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9f3516ec28f15d8bb5bfa9ee57aed858301fa4fd) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Refactor `serialization.ts` into modular `serialization/` files. No runtime change.

- [#1935](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1935) [`d0e3f27`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d0e3f2722b744472a90e48062e3876040e21de82) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Preserve the `this` binding of bound step proxies across workflow serialization, so passing `useStep(...).bind(thisArg)` as a step argument no longer loses the receiver.

- [#1491](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1491) [`e295bae`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e295bae417bd072f8e18e8d07c76d90d40ae7cec) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Allow `start()` to be called directly inside workflow functions

### Patch Changes

- [#1848](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1848) [`7d07fab`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7d07fab692ba79d0339b093a45f5beecb219639e) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Replace `eval` in `serialization.ts` `revive()` helper with `JSON.parse`. `devalue.stringify()` output is always valid JSON (special values are encoded as negative integer sentinels), so `JSON.parse` is a safe drop-in that eliminates the `eval` anti-pattern.

## 4.0.1-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- 5eb588a: Remove step function identifier transform out of swc-plugin and into `useStep()` runtime function
- 00b0bb9: Implement the world's structured error interface
- 85ce8e0: add waitUntil wrapping for toplevel commands for transaction-like behavior

  when deployed on Vercel or other serverless providers, we must signal that we need to wait until operations are done before the function can halt the request.

  This means that we can't rely on discrete operations (like Queue.queue or Storage calls), and instead wrap the entire `start` function (which calls multiple discrete operations) in a single `await waitUntil` call.

## 4.0.1-beta.10

### Patch Changes

- 7013f29: **BREAKING**: Change `RetryableError` "retryAfter" option number value to represent milliseconds instead of seconds.
