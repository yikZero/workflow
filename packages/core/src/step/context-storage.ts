   *
   * The canonical case is a step-initiated `AbortController.abort()`: the
   * durable `hook_received` event records the cancellation in the workflow's
   * event log. If it is flushed in the background (like `ops`), the workflow
   * continuation enqueued by `step_completed` can run — and advance past the
   * abort, dispatching a later step with a stale, non-aborted `signal` — before
   * the `hook_received` event exists. Awaiting these inline before completion
   * guarantees the abort is ordered ahead of any continuation that observes the
   * step's result. Unlike these, `ops` holds best-effort real-time stream
   * writes that should fire ASAP and are intentionally left in the background.
   *
   * Contract: producers MUST NOT push a promise that can reject — these are
   * awaited only to enforce ordering, never to surface an outcome. A rejection
   * here would propagate as an infra error (queue re-delivery), not the
   * user-code failure path, so each producer swallows its own errors (see
   * `reviveAbortController` in serialization.ts). The await sites also
   * defensively `.catch()` so ordering is all this bucket can ever enforce.
   *
   * Required (not optional) so a new step-context construction site that
   * forgets to wire it fails at compile time, rather than silently regressing
   * the ordering guarantee back to background-flush behavior.
