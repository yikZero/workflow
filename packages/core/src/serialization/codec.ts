/**
 * Codec interface for serialization formats.
 *
 * A codec handles the core serialize/deserialize logic for a specific
 * wire format (devalue, CBOR, JSON, etc.). Each codec is responsible
 * for handling all supported data types internally — the caller only
 * specifies which serialization mode to use.
 *
 * - **devalue**: Uses custom reducers/revivers for Date, Error, Map, Set,
 *   typed arrays, class instances, etc.
 * - **cbor**: Would handle Date, typed arrays, Map, Set natively via the
 *   CBOR type system. Class instances would still need custom handling.
 * - **json**: Would only support standard JSON types (primitives, arrays,
 *   plain objects). No Date, Map, Set, typed arrays, etc.
