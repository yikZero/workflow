/**
 * Lazy accessor for the World singleton via globalThis symbols.
 *
 * This module exists to break the static import chain from step-side
 * modules (serialization, run, helpers, start) to world.ts. Without it,
 * esbuild bundles world.ts (and its transitive deps: world-local,
 * world-vercel, process.cwd(), etc.) into the step registrations bundle,
 * which triggers Turbopack NFT tracing errors in the V2 combined flow route.
 *
 * Resolution order, in priority:
 *
 * 1. `globalThis[WorldCacheKey]` — populated by a successful prior
 *    `getWorld()` call. This is the steady-state hot path.
 * 2. `globalThis[GetWorldFnKey]` — populated by the module-load side
 *    effect at the bottom of `./world.ts`. Fires on every server bundle
 *    that reaches this file via `workflow/api` (which imports
 *    `./world-init.ts` for its side effect; see that file for the full
 *    rationale). This is the cold-start path for routes that consume
 *    `start` without any prior workflow run.
 * 3. Dynamic `import('./world.js')` — last-resort fallback for
 *    environments where neither (1) nor (2) is available (CJS test
 *    runners, scripts that import deeply into `@workflow/core` without
 *    going through `workflow/api`, future bundlers we haven't validated).
 *    The specifier is built at runtime so esbuild can't trace it into
 *    step bundles. Note: this branch is unreliable in webpack-bundled
 *    routes because webpack inlines this module into the route file and
 *    the relative path resolves against the bundle location — paths (1)
 *    and (2) cover those cases instead.
