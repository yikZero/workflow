 * beginning to execute. STSO (step-to-step overhead) measures the previous
 * step's terminal event → the next step's body beginning to execute. RSFS
 * (run-started-to-first-step) measures the `run_started` response landing →
 * the first step's start POST being issued — a sub-window of TTFS that
 * isolates replay overhead from the run-creation queue hop; `finalSchedulingReplay`
 * is the synchronous workflow-function-execution duration of only the FINAL
 * replay pass within that window (the pass that reached and scheduled the
 * first step) — it is NOT accumulated across earlier pre-first-step passes
 * (see {@link StepLatencyTracking.replayMs}), so it must not be read as "the
 * replay portion of RSFS". All are attached to the step's terminal
 * event so a backend can emit latency metrics from the event write alone,
 * without extra event-log queries.
 *
 * Eligibility is decided by the orchestrator (which owns the event log) via
