## 5.0.0-beta.33

### Patch Changes

- [#3914](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3914) [`4a18b01`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4a18b0133aaedaf922b903818c6b0db3adc91beb) Thanks [@shalabhc](https://github.com/shalabhc)! - Accept lazy completed and failed runs whose payload is represented by a remote reference.

- [#3901](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3901) [`5c4eef0`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5c4eef0a97ef0fc23f0ca6edf52ee891068dde15) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Upgrade repository tooling and CI from pnpm 10 to pnpm 11.

## 5.0.0-beta.32

### Patch Changes

- [#3849](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3849) [`855e479`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/855e47990c0da35419325da27976bae925afb0e9) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix runs failing with `CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG` after every step had already succeeded, when the event log held two attribute writes under one id.

- [#3841](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3841) [`2668e33`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2668e3325ba89dec973c3c2f35c49efdb239de8d) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Make `resumeHook()` durable before it resolves: the `hook_received` event is
  written durably first, and the workflow wake is published only after the write
  is acknowledged. A disposal racing the queue delivery can no longer lose a
  resume the caller was told succeeded. The wake message is unchanged, so no
  consumer or backend coordination is needed; `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_LAZY_HOOK_RESUME`
  is now a no-op and the internal `resumeHookDurable()` alias is removed.

  Behavior changes: a resume against an ended run now throws `HookNotFoundError`
  instead of resolving (the lazy path never observed the server's rejection, so a
  late webhook delivery to a finished run answered 202 where it now answers 404).
  A transient write conflict (HTTP 409, e.g. an event-slot conflict under
  contention) is no longer re-keyed to `HookNotFoundError`: it surfaces as a
  retryable error, since its transaction committed nothing.

- [#3878](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3878) [`ffc5807`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ffc58078d0c3cd2786d69bab7e41614566a9ea4e) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Stop logging on healthy workflow execution: the breadcrumbs that only described the runtime working correctly now print under `DEBUG=workflow:*`. Warnings and errors are unchanged.

## 5.0.0-beta.31

### Patch Changes

- [#3794](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3794) [`d9e0777`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d9e0777eb8b1ce5f3be3fe865bc5a17fdbdb9d5d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Document that `hookInput` and the `(runId, resumeId)` dedup contract now cover repeated deliveries of one resume rather than a producer/consumer race, and accept `lazy` as a hook-resume strategy.

## 5.0.0-beta.30

### Major Changes

- [#3550](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3550) [`d62b444`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d62b44473b43e183e71386fe84b33f5e7bb5445c) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Keep schema-only World modules out of workflow VM bundles, prevent unknown attribute deletions from offsetting new keys, and safely ignore prototype-like event type names.

## 5.0.0-beta.29

### Minor Changes

- [#3570](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3570) [`9454d51`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9454d51db0d52d6be9bafea9c70ab6fc3a1ceba4) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add `world.runs.waitForTerminalStatus(runId, { timeoutMs, signal, resolveData })` method, which long-polls until the run reaches a terminal status. `await run.returnValue` now internally uses this, if the World supports it, instead of using a polling interval.

- [#3634](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3634) [`7b79ba3`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7b79ba37cc97e858ceb8b2474e03bbc404b555a0) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - New runs are created with the sealed-log event identity (specVersion 7). A sealed-log run's event positions are assigned by the backend before each write commits, so concurrent writers never contend for a position. A position whose writer dies is closed by the backend with a `noop` event; replay steps over those without delivering them or advancing the deterministic clock. Set `WORKFLOW_SEALED_LOG=0` to put a deployment back on the previous scheme. Every runtime reads sealed logs either way, and a run's version is fixed at creation, so the setting only affects new runs.

### Patch Changes

- [#3728](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3728) [`f771585`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f771585486b3019c8d68211b158dfeffc9e5ebe8) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Hold process-wide state on `globalThis` rather than at module scope in the packages that get bundled into the host application's server build, where a bundler compiles one copy of each module per layer. Covers warn-once latches, lazy caches, the VM script and QuickJS asset caches, the dev-server port cache, and step single-flight, whose per-copy map was not actually single-flight. State that is deliberately per-copy is annotated with the reason.

- [#3743](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3743) [`bf9de1c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/bf9de1cd81eda1b1721b857364070c0ce70d1e58) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - A wait-continuation delivered before its wait elapses now re-arms under a fresh idempotency key instead of losing the wait's timer. Previously the re-enqueue reused a key the early delivery had already spent, so the world's dedupe window dropped it and the run slept indefinitely with nothing scheduled to wake it.

## 5.0.0-beta.28

### Minor Changes

- [#3461](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3461) [`04e060a`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/04e060a0ecc247a3291714d8396430fa9d96bccc) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add `WORKFLOW_NODE_HTTP` to run the Vercel and Local World HTTP layers on Node's built-in `node:http` and `node:https` modules instead of their usual HTTP client library.

### Patch Changes

- [#3025](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3025) [`b0adb50`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b0adb50bce623b23252735021205e8d870a2b11f) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add `world.events.createBatch` World API method, which allows writing ordered events in one durable write, returning per-event outcomes. Optional. On by default if implemented by the World. Disable with `WORKFLOW_BATCH_TRANSITIONS=0`.

- [#3568](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3568) [`37e1d9e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/37e1d9e5a9870ef4a35e1875e7054253a9fb89c3) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Pre-claim inline steps inside the suspension batch, so a fan-out's inline step bodies start off the batch commit with no per-step claim request

- [#3497](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3497) [`1321570`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/13215704645ea487ef6f8821016ec3f13c1cd830) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Log ignored duplicate events at `debug` instead of `info`/`error`, so a straggler no longer prints on every replay of the run.

## 5.0.0-beta.27

### Minor Changes

- [#3390](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3390) [`600b096`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/600b096d2fa5423b742683fcd047010a1f1bfcd6) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Add a bounded batch analytics event lookup for enriching canonical event pages.

- [#3365](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3365) [`7683130`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7683130461a1a3de16c13be52d8aee96590b3814) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Resilient step dispatch: newly created steps are published to the queue in parallel with their `step_created` event write, with the serialized input carried on the message (`stepInput`) so the consumer re-ensures the event if the direct write failed transiently — mirroring resilient start (`runInput`) and resilient hook resume (`hookInput`). Worlds that enforce the precondition guard keep the sequential create-then-publish dispatch (only sequencing gives the message a happens-after edge over the create's guard verdict); step-dispatch idempotency keys are now step-identity-scoped. Disable via `WORKFLOW_RESILIENT_STEP_DISPATCH=0`.

### Patch Changes

- [#3519](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3519) [`dc85865`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/dc85865718fdf5e4abdb5ad8edf715ec956bf07d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Remove the `preconditionGuard` World capability. A stale replay-context write no longer needs to be rejected: a reader holds a prefix of the log, replay is deterministic on a prefix, and the writer's next write reports the events it was pushed past.

- [#3381](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3381) [`efbc408`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/efbc408c4e98178dc8c8151764f308e9e4b6fd58) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Ignore duplicate events that a concurrent replay wrote for an entity the event log already records, instead of failing the run with a corrupted event log

- [#3437](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3437) [`a0ccfe0`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a0ccfe0f50df1e6726b033e91c41257065e20edd) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add OTEL telemetry for hook-triggered time-to-resume: `workflow.resume.total_ms` plus a non-overlapping phase breakdown, on the first durable step after a resume.

- [#3542](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3542) [`de2a86c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/de2a86c61c843a04c292e54e9c439553b3da02c5) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - **Breaking**: New runs are created at spec version 6, and a World that declares an older spec version is now rejected before the first run rather than failing partway through one.

- [#3519](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3519) [`dc85865`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/dc85865718fdf5e4abdb5ad8edf715ec956bf07d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Require every event id the runtime reads to be a log position. `requireEventSlot` replaces the lenient decode that returned "no position" for an id that is not a slot.

- [#3519](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3519) [`dc85865`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/dc85865718fdf5e4abdb5ad8edf715ec956bf07d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Slot-numbered event ids are a requirement of the World contract, not a capability. The `slotEventIds` flag is gone, and the conformance suite now fails a World whose event ids are not positions.

- [#3479](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3479) [`b589460`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b589460ce873bad3ddd7bda4a9bff147ddccac49) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Replay-context event writes now always report the log position they replayed from, and the `WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD` flag is removed.

## 5.0.0-beta.26

### Minor Changes

- [#3374](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3374) [`439a495`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/439a495a715b9426ef4dbcf8d928a8fc50ffb040) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Carry the run's pinned deployment on lazy resume messages so misrouted deliveries re-route before the `hook_received` write.

### Patch Changes

- [#3385](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3385) [`74dbf81`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/74dbf81d327b8574cca429b56757c7322a26b4ef) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Retry replay timeouts through normal queue redelivery instead of exiting the process, and keep Postgres jobs retryable through Core's terminal delivery limit.

- [#3382](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3382) [`a8db185`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a8db185c3b19b3dab971f51aa076aead81ed26ea) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fold new events returned by `events.create` into the replay log so a completed wait no longer needs a follow-up `events.list` round trip

- [#3389](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3389) [`6786db9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6786db99538ef57c872d861ecfb28d99ae857d6d) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - **Breaking**: SpecVersion 6: Event IDs are now a dense per-run slot number, allocated by the world at publish time so a rejected write leaves no gap in the event log. A replay tells the world how many events it had read and gets back the ones it did not see, so an event that arrives from outside the replay and lands ahead of an event the replay wrote no longer fails the run with `CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG`: it is held for whichever part of the workflow awaits it. A gap in the numbering fails the run instead of being replayed over.

- [#3205](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3205) [`22349e9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/22349e95fd85a112cbec3f425900b74bf5ccc77f) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Load replay-event suffixes through one World request.

- [#3124](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3124) [`65139ac`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/65139acfd7118d3b73672435a6e1c47115f6e23f) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Infer required run and step entities, including their start times, from
  `events.create` request types.

## 5.0.0-beta.25

### Major Changes

- [#3280](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3280) [`de1905f`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/de1905f15c0a31f272966ac518ebf272864ea5c6) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - **Breaking:** `events.listByCorrelationId` and `analytics.events.listByCorrelationId` now require a `runId`. A correlation id is unique within its run, not across runs, so an unscoped lookup answered with one event per run that numbered a step or wait the same.

### Minor Changes

- [#3347](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3347) [`8d47928`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8d479283cabd9de84fa2542c4ff16f2697d16399) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add a bulk run cancellation primitive. `@workflow/world` defines the `BulkCancelWorkflowRuns*` contract and an optional `runs.cancelMany`; `@workflow/world-vercel` implements it via a single `POST /v4/runs/cancel`; `@workflow/core` adds a `cancelRuns` helper that uses `cancelMany` when available and falls back to bounded-concurrency single-run cancellation.

- [#2960](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2960) [`79e4c04`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/79e4c044091185e68bbdcc254a86133e54956ad3) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Re-route a queue delivery that reaches a deployment other than the one its run is pinned to, retry transient publishing failures through normal queue redelivery, and fail the run with the new `DEPLOYMENT_MISMATCH` error code once the recovery budget is spent.

- [#3345](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3345) [`9c1b3c8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9c1b3c86384181b673d41123d2eec0b987afc75a) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Initialize lazy hook resume replay from the `hook_received` write via the new advisory `preloadEvents` param, skipping `run_started` and the initial `events.list`; safe fallback otherwise.

- [#2866](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2866) [`e6f1b6f`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e6f1b6f5489da19f736fcd86a06a03d8247e5b78) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Keep Hook tokens reserved through their configured minimum retention.

### Patch Changes

- [#3360](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3360) [`72efc90`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/72efc90f286956e6cde25b814f9375a8ecbbff36) Thanks [@elliotdauber](https://github.com/elliotdauber)! - Derive inline-execution duration limits from `World.getRuntimeDeadline()` (implemented on Vercel World via `@vercel/functions`).

## 5.0.0-beta.24

### Minor Changes

- [#3186](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3186) [`4a9d26b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4a9d26b1cb807a9e31489350b468db42a8c13ef3) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Record the compute instance that ran each step attempt: `CreateEventParams.computeInstanceId` is stamped on `step_started` writes, forwarded in the world-vercel v4 frame meta alongside `vercelId`, read back on `AnalyticsEvent` / `AnalyticsStep`, and surfaced as "Compute Instance ID" in the observability attribute panel.

- [#3145](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3145) [`1471f25`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1471f252fa18024695f1bf149f5bee4876ab149e) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Strengthen the event-creation precondition guard: replay-context writes now also send the number of loaded events, so a snapshot that is missing an event is rejected instead of committing a divergent event log, and a rejection restarts the replay in-process (consuming the events a world may attach to the rejection) rather than re-committing the rejected payload or re-invoking over the queue. `@workflow/world-local` and `@workflow/world-postgres` do not implement the check.

- [#3230](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3230) [`31f92df`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/31f92df10d295cf09c93aadd35380209c137326c) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Lazy hook resumption: on a fast path, `resumeHook()` writes the `hook_received` event and dispatches the workflow queue message concurrently instead of sequentially, cutting a round trip off resume latency. A `(runId, resumeId)` dedup constraint keeps the two writers converging on exactly one event; the runtime falls back to the sequential path when dedup support is unavailable or when `WORKFLOW_DISABLE_LAZY_HOOK_RESUME=1`. `resumeHook()` resolves to a `ResumedHook` (a `Hook` plus an optional `resilientResume: true` flag, set only when the direct write failed transiently and the resume was recovered via the queue consumer's re-ensure) — preserving the contract introduced alongside the resilient-resume work.

- [#1834](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1834) [`438eaa6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/438eaa6a595811e6d6942ba679e831d25e6cbfbe) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Make `resumeHook()` resilient to transient `hook_received` event write failures (429/5xx) by carrying the payload on the queue message for the runtime to materialize. Returned `Hook` gets a new `resilientResume: true` flag when this fallback path is taken.

- [#3244](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3244) [`ee944d2`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ee944d2476daca81b89ba545b522385a7902ec03) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add an optional `World.getEnvironment()` hook and an optional `environment` field on `RunInputSchema`, so the environment a run was created in can travel with its queue message.

### Patch Changes

- [#3208](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3208) [`4017597`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4017597a5f6a54da7ea3bf467c8c63b3bf3bc845) Thanks [@alangenfeld](https://github.com/alangenfeld)! - Report replay-divergence counts on event writes that recover or exhaust replay retries.

## 5.0.0-beta.23

### Major Changes

- [#3061](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3061) [`62d570e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/62d570ed4bf38db333ae9fe9ba513c0d6a9d6b91) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Remove legacy step queue topics and payloads now that queued steps use the workflow topic and combined flow handler.

### Minor Changes

- [#3095](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3095) [`b4ba79e`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b4ba79ebc501248408474efdd6e353f1753d83e3) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Persist and transport the new optional `encryptionPublicKey` field on workflow runs, carried on `run_created` (and `run_started` for resilient start).

- [#3099](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3099) [`a86035f`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a86035f71f60e22170cae231cc6fb07e39928cc6) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - The cross-deployment capability probe now returns the target run's public key, letting `start()` seal workflow arguments without a separate key-lookup request.

### Patch Changes

- [#3111](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3111) [`8c12358`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8c12358075897ef1fdcc4ce3847579df63c8ca7a) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Clarify runtime invariants and compression behavior.

- [#3125](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3125) [`d24c91c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d24c91cfde678e9a4935ee94b9597b5696d6792b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Hooks can carry an optional `resumeContext`; when present, `resumeHook`/`resumeWebhook` resume from it directly instead of fetching the full run, saving a round trip per resume. When the context also carries the run's `encryptionPublicKey`, the resume seals its payload (`encp`) directly to that key, so a default webhook resume needs neither a run read nor a run-key lookup. These two optimizations fall back independently: it fetches the full run when the context is absent, and uses symmetric encryption when no usable public key is available.

- [#3088](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/3088) [`fc81f45`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fc81f4502fa6d8d9a7a5c48b44394dc39c141a86) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Stream writes dispatch the first chunk of an idle stream immediately (flush window default 0 instead of 10ms). Fast producers keep full batching via in-flight accumulation; set `streamFlushIntervalMs` (World option) or `WORKFLOW_STREAM_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` (env, takes precedence) above 0 to opt into a windowed leading edge.

## 5.0.0-beta.22

- [#2915](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2915) [`7d29bab`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7d29babaef6d048153631d9ee7241b4b0953f9d3) Thanks [@joeyhotz](https://github.com/joeyhotz)! - Add `runs.getMany()` for retrieving ordered workflow run snapshots in one storage operation.

- [#2865](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2865) [`a5e6f11`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a5e6f1167aa07f36b49777d3c020282d11a0abf2) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Add `experimental_minRetention` for keeping a Hook token unavailable after its run ends, and require supporting Worlds to advertise the `hookRetention` capability.

- [#2970](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2970) [`bb773e9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/bb773e950786b15100a8058407cbfcba23a44ebc) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add an optional `capabilities?: WorldCapabilities` field to the World interface so implementations can declare backend feature support (`preconditionGuard`, `maxConcurrency`) instead of the runtime inferring it from environment variables; the Vercel World declares both.

### Patch Changes

- [#2986](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2986) [`fe12b84`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fe12b847291912cf9e47143ee10c73828dbdf1a1) Thanks [@shalabhc](https://github.com/shalabhc)! - Enforce a server-supplied per-run event limit (default 25K)

- [#2946](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2946) [`eb8fdb9`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/eb8fdb979748f54a94289530ee7ac155feddddcc) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - The `WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD` event-creation guard is now on by default; opt out with `WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD=0`.

## 5.0.0-beta.21

### Minor Changes

- [#2266](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2266) [`a00d169`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/a00d16947085f8e94cf191c4d8850121cf201a94) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add an opt-in optimistic-concurrency guard for event creation (`WORKFLOW_PRECONDITION_GUARD=1`): replay-context event creations send a `stateUpdatedAt` snapshot timestamp, and the runtime reloads the event log and retries (then falls back to a queue re-invocation) when the backend reports a newer out-of-band event with a 412 `PreconditionFailedError`.

- [#2929](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2929) [`1933e29`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1933e294cf938fb2314f45047033f8720ccf442b) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Report run-started-to-first-step (rsfs) and final-scheduling-replay (finalSchedulingReplay) latency telemetry on step completion events.

### Patch Changes

- [#2153](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2153) [`6b8efd5`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/6b8efd58ce4829648f410e483bf42935dc5dcd1e) Thanks [@rchasman](https://github.com/rchasman)! - Record cross-run lineage when `start()` is called from inside a workflow or step: the new run is tagged with `$parentRunId` (its direct parent) and inherits the parent's `$rootRunId`, so a daisy chain or fan-out of any depth groups under one root id.

## 5.0.0-beta.20

### Minor Changes

- [#2903](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2903) [`f2be954`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f2be954bb7fee078bc4b78118edaa157130fa362) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add `analytics.attributes.list()` for attribute key discovery, and an `attributes` key=value filter to `analytics.runs.list()`.

- [#1981](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1981) [`9da2d76`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/9da2d762604c2b73eb39f07fc0b069aea643e18d) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Add optional `createRunId(options?)` to the `World` interface and `region` to `QueueOptions`. Worlds can now mint custom run IDs (reading whichever start-option fields they recognise) and route messages to a specific region.

### Patch Changes

- [#2899](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2899) [`ac41e7d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ac41e7d1d77d48d783ca49d01394dc325afd7ea2) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Parse timezone-naive analytics timestamps as UTC so CLI and local web output shows correct times in any timezone.

- [#2896](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2896) [`c31e30c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/c31e30caacab20c0d9c0df38349929ae1e0aebdf) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Show world-specific run fields (e.g. region on Vercel) in `workflow inspect` output via the new optional `World.describeRun` hook.

## 5.0.0-beta.19

### Patch Changes

- [#2888](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2888) [`7a1ea5a`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/7a1ea5a45afd07601934a2f3ff1d1044f3bd9db8) Thanks [@ctgowrie](https://github.com/ctgowrie)! - Use the active queue namespace when re-enqueuing workflow runs during world startup recovery.

- [#2882](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2882) [`0b956f6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/0b956f65cb0ab30501c72e934fc8d4352c4c3ea2) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Update doc comments to reference `setAttributes` (renamed from `experimental_setAttributes`).

## 5.0.0-beta.18

### Minor Changes

- [#2850](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2850) [`f28150c`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f28150c62667f069dbe3c47e83102fef499ab92b) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Report step progress alongside step-to-step overhead latency telemetry.

- [#2790](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2790) [`145835b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/145835b6475f7fcc7e9983b2c7080f3433018ec9) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Centralize workflow event type classifiers and event-data payload field helpers.

### Patch Changes

- [#2848](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2848) [`6603628`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/66036282b5d18c9bef4dea4275782bc977842606) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Fix duplicate inline step execution when a hook or wait wakes a run while the step is still running (#2780). The lazy `step_started` now records the owning queue message ID, and wake replays schedule a delayed backstop for in-flight inline steps instead of immediately re-dispatching them. Disable with `WORKFLOW_INLINE_OWNERSHIP=0`.

## 5.0.0-beta.17

### Minor Changes

- [#2833](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2833) [`3f69666`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/3f696668bcc436cd4b3e29213ee1d9d12e2e5b01) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Report time-to-first-step and step-to-step overhead latency telemetry on step completion events.

### Patch Changes

- [#2840](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2840) [`712ed61`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/712ed61f0a37937c3990429508c582f3edbd4576) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add an optional reason to run cancellation (`run.cancel({ cancelReason })`), recorded on the cancellation event and shown in the run detail view.

## 5.0.0-beta.16

### Patch Changes

- [#2812](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2812) [`fe327e6`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/fe327e69e205417f864fc4109f6e8b79e92e141a) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Support `startTime`/`endTime` on `world.analytics.runs.list` to bound the listing window.

## 5.0.0-beta.15

### Minor Changes

- [#2234](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2234) [`f76377b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/f76377bf04239eccd8c85a6db19d0465e7bdb2ee) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Add an optional metadata-only `world.analytics` namespace for observability reads (runs, steps, events, hooks, waits). Implemented by `@workflow/world-vercel`; payload-bearing fields remain on the canonical runtime storage APIs.

- [#2718](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2718) [`cc7f076`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/cc7f076528ca8ba6ee824628b82bee64fd5672a8) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Make runtime tuning constants (timeouts, retry counts, stream buffering/reconnect) configurable via `WORKFLOW_*` environment variables, and forward `WORKFLOW_TEST_LIMIT_OVERRIDES` to the backend as a request header so a deployment can tighten server-side limits for testing.

### Patch Changes

- [#2747](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2747) [`2ab7057`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2ab70579542a359db818d771ece5a19cd8fdd399) Thanks [@NathanColosimo](https://github.com/NathanColosimo)! - Keep local hooks reachable after a crash or restart by rebuilding lost hook cache files from committed hook creation events, preventing active hook tokens from being reused.

## 5.0.0-beta.14

### Patch Changes

- [#2622](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2622) [`48e6bbf`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/48e6bbfcc37b7997c33eb1ea3c662d553bfc5d07) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Declare Zod as a runtime dependency so exported schemas are built with the package's own Zod version instead of the consuming application's peer.

## 5.0.0-beta.13

### Patch Changes

- [#2580](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2580) [`25c3df7`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/25c3df74f88726f9336ca20e6c48fd3366c40749) Thanks [@karthikscale3](https://github.com/karthikscale3)! - Send optional client-side event occurrence timestamps through world event creation.

- [#2569](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2569) [`d108ba3`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/d108ba32a76d516deadaa7264aec79412d862626) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Turbo mode now tells world-vercel to skip the run_started event-log preload it never reads, reducing request time.

## 5.0.0-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- [#2475](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2475) [`2074f91`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2074f91b86c43267549625fd89f597c7bedf44ca) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Skip the per-step incremental `events.list` round-trip in the inline sequential loop by consuming an event-log delta returned from the step's terminal write (gated to the single-step case with no open hooks or waits).

  Add the opt-in `CreateEventParams.sinceCursor` contract so a step-terminal `events.create` can return the event-log delta since that cursor (via `EventResult.events`/`cursor`/`hasMore`).

  Return the inline delta from a step-terminal write when `sinceCursor` is supplied, computed identically to `events.list` so the consumed prefix cannot skew from the server log.

  Forward `sinceCursor` over the v4 wire in `@workflow/world-vercel` so the server can return the delta on a step-terminal response; older servers ignore it and the runtime falls back to `events.list`.

- [#2478](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2478) [`e7ef9d8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/e7ef9d823bd6c962d9c0c62e50e4883848c270f9) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Lazy inline step start: the owned-inline runtime path now sends a single `step_started` carrying the step input, letting the world create the step on the fly and saving one round-trip per inline step.

  `@workflow/world`: `step_started` event data accepts an optional `input`, and `EventResult` gains a `stepCreated` ownership signal.

  `@workflow/world-local`: `step_started` with input atomically creates the step plus a synthetic `step_created` event; a lazy `step_started` for an already-existing step throws `EntityConflictError` so concurrent losers skip (exactly-once).

  `@workflow/world-postgres`: same lazy-create + exactly-once create-claim for the Postgres backend.

  `@workflow/world-vercel`: sends the step input on `step_started` over the v4 wire and threads the server's `stepCreated` signal into `EventResult`.

- [#2511](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2511) [`ab2e9b8`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ab2e9b8d0740c457f80e05f05c1fd907bcf4f027) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Emit `workflowName` on per-step events (`step_created`, `step_completed`, and lazy-start `step_started`) so Worlds can access it without additional queries

## 5.0.0-beta.11

### Minor Changes

- [#2394](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2394) [`5f0b845`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/5f0b845211152b6f2860c78d0dd4dccc9d4f0d97) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Bump `SPEC_VERSION_CURRENT` to 5 (`SPEC_VERSION_SUPPORTS_COMPRESSION`): runs at spec 5+ may contain gzip-compressed payloads, and older SDKs reject them via `requiresNewerWorld()` instead of failing on individual payloads.

## 5.0.0-beta.10

### Minor Changes

- [#2385](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2385) [`628795a`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/628795aa8729bef442c7a1583cf2f3d986e9e4fc) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Add an `allowReservedAttributes` option to `start()` so framework-level callers can seed reserved `$`-prefixed run attributes at creation, matching the existing `experimental_setAttributes` option. The flag is carried through the resilient-start queue input so lazy run creation validates identically.

## 5.0.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- [#2226](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2226) [`ae8d6fe`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ae8d6feeda0d1d31da8da70156d6e04ebb0487d0) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Allow passing initial run attributes through `start()`, and speed up workflow-level `setAttribute` calls by using native events for recording attributes.

## 5.0.0-beta.8

### Minor Changes

- [#2305](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2305) [`4670c4b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/4670c4b92d7386dfd74728538c7e24fe8c07b0af) Thanks [@willsather](https://github.com/willsather)! - Add an optional `namespace` parameter that scopes queue topic prefixes to `__{namespace}_wkf_workflow_*`. This allows configuring multiple frameworks in the same deployment without queue topic collision.

## 5.0.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- [#2212](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2212) [`2a3b11b`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2a3b11bcb408f1aa071b0e37f0b2df614052acd1) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Retry transient workflow replay divergence before classifying repeated divergence as a corrupted event log.

## 5.0.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- [#2191](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2191) [`8f68d35`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/8f68d3525ce3e420f4d16b9976c97a5598f91afd) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Fix forwarded writable stream encryption when child workflows execute on a newer deployment than their parent.

## 5.0.0-beta.5

### Patch Changes

- [#2134](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2134) [`1e6b1fd`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1e6b1fdea2010c1f55b3e6fb5386d436c4406eb4) Thanks [@VaguelySerious](https://github.com/VaguelySerious)! - Add `experimental_setAttributes()` workflow-level helper for attaching string key/value metadata to a workflow run, surfaced as `run.attributes`

- [#1979](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1979) [`62ec537`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/62ec5372fb7dc0d8d088be0c55db35d14eea5b14) Thanks [@adamiBs](https://github.com/adamiBs)! - Make `run.input` and `step.input` `.optional()` on the World snapshot schemas so consumers no longer fail validation when the service externalizes payloads as `RemoteRef` blobs.

- [#1799](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/1799) [`503a929`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/503a929d347df46eb0ad63b068da7781762d0dc8) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Use inline sourcemaps for all workspace packages; published packages no longer ship external `.js.map` files.

## 5.0.0-beta.4

- [#2038](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2038) [`dc0be50`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/dc0be50618bd6a465e3f9768ee7427d282aa1fd7) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Refresh workflow events after completing elapsed waits so concurrent hook events preserve deterministic replay order.

- [#2046](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2046) [`ad71b58`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/ad71b58bba65e739fbafee0440ffff48878e7e51) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Report corrupted event logs with a distinct `CorruptedEventLogError` type and `CORRUPTED_EVENT_LOG` run error code.

- [#2030](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2030) [`b124365`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/b124365e14b0c47a5c830c7009dd5bf0149d5a59) Thanks [@pranaygp](https://github.com/pranaygp)! - Validate step, wait, and hook lifecycle events against replay ownership metadata.

- [#2013](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/2013) [`2a446af`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/2a446af517dbb91ae959adade1d74ef0428a2b09) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - Exclude inline step execution from the workflow replay timeout. Long-running steps no longer hit `REPLAY_TIMEOUT` (fixes #2009). Adds a `WORKFLOW_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_MS` env var override and a new optional `World.processExitTriggersQueueRedelivery` capability used to gate the runtime's `process.exit(1)` failure path.

Pre-upgrade failed runs in the `world-postgres` legacy `error` text column surface as `error: undefined` on read; the original payload is still readable directly from the `errorJson` column for manual inspection.

  - Remove `cancel`, `pause`, `resume` from `runs`
  - Remove `create`, `update` from `runs`, `steps`, `hooks`
  - Add run lifecycle events: `run_created`, `run_started`, `run_completed`, `run_failed`, `run_cancelled`

- [#853](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/pull/853) [`1060f9d`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/commit/1060f9d04a372bf6de6c5c3d52063bcc22dba6e8) Thanks [@TooTallNate](https://github.com/TooTallNate)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Change user input/output to be binary data (Uint8Array) at the World interface

  This is part of specVersion 2 changes where serialization of workflow and step data uses binary format instead of JSON arrays. This allows the workflow client to be fully responsible for the data serialization format and enables future enhancements such as encryption and compression without the World implementation needing to care about the underlying data representation.
