 * 5xx can mean the chunk *was* written but the response failed, and a retry
 * would duplicate it. Other 4xx are client errors a retry can't fix. `methods`
 * is pinned to PUT (the only stream-write verb) for clarity; `errorCodes` is
 * left at undici's transient-network-error defaults. Exported so a test can
 * assert that 5xx never sneaks back into the retryable set.
