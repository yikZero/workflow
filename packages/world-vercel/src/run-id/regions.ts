/**
 * Stable mapping between Vercel compute region codes (e.g. `iad1`) and the
 * 6-bit region IDs encoded into tagged workflow run IDs.
 *
 * **DO NOT REORDER OR REUSE IDS.** Once a region has been assigned an ID, that
 * ID is part of the on-the-wire encoding of every run ID ever issued for that
 * region. New regions must be appended with the next unused ID.
 *
 * `0` is reserved for "unknown" — encode functions may emit it when the
 * caller's region cannot be determined, and decode will surface it as
 * `region: null`.
 *
 * The list below covers the 21 currently-deployed Vercel compute regions plus
 * `hel1` and `zrh1`, which are reserved for future rollout so they can be
 * assigned without requiring a version bump.
