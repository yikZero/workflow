    longDescription:
      'Cancel a running AI agent from the outside — for example, a Stop button in a chat UI, an admin cancellation endpoint, or a timeout fallback. Two patterns are available depending on whether you need the agent to exit cleanly or just need the run to stop: Hard Cancellation via `getRun(runId).cancel()` for immediate forced termination, or Stop Signal via a `stopHook` + `Promise.race` for a graceful exit that runs cleanup and streams a `data-stopped` part to the client so it renders a clean ending instead of an abrupt connection close. The stop route falls back to hard cancel automatically if the hook is already gone — so the Stop button always succeeds regardless of timing.',

      "[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is Vercel's framework-agnostic TypeScript toolkit for building AI-powered apps and agents — unified provider access, streaming, tool calling, structured output, and UI hooks. Workflow SDK complements it by making those calls durable: the model request, the tool loop, and the multi-turn conversation all survive restarts and timeouts. For most agent use cases, prefer `DurableAgent` which wraps `streamText` and manages the tool loop automatically. This pattern covers using `streamText()` directly when you need lower-level control.",

    longDescription:
      'The [`@vercel/sandbox`](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-sandbox) package has first-class support for the Workflow SDK — the `Sandbox` class is serializable, and its methods (`create`, `runCommand`, `stop`, `snapshot`) implicitly run as steps, so you can use `Sandbox` directly inside a workflow function without wrapping each call in `"use step"`. Wrapping the sandbox in a workflow run gives you a durable controller for its entire lifetime: auto-hibernation on idle, proactive rollover before the 5-hour sandbox hard cap, and reconnection by a single `runId` — so one logical session can run effectively forever on top of time-bounded infrastructure.',
