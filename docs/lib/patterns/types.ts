/**
 * Registry — installable Workflow patterns powered by `shadcn add`.
 *
 * Each `RegistryItem` is a recipe (workflow + API routes + UI) you can drop
 * into your app via the shadcn CLI. The data here drives both the listing
 * page (`/patterns`) and the per-item detail page (`/patterns/[id]`).
 *
 * To add a new provider:
 *   1. Append a new `RegistryItem` to `manifest.ts`.
 *   2. Author the source snippets and reference them via `snippets`.
 *   3. Submit the corresponding registry JSON to the shadcn registry index
 *      (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-index) so the
 *      `installCommand` actually resolves.
