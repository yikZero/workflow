# Migrating to Vercel Workflow

Use this skill when converting an existing orchestration system to Vercel Workflow.

## Intake

1. Identify the source system:
   - Temporal
   - Inngest
   - AWS Step Functions
2. Identify the target runtime:
   - Deploying on Vercel -> keep examples focused on `start()`, `getRun()`, hooks/webhooks, and route handlers.
   - Non-Vercel or self-hosted -> also read `references/runtime-targets.md`.
3. Extract the source constructs:
   - entrypoint
   - waits / timers
   - external callbacks / approvals
   - retries / failure handling
   - child workflows / fan-out
   - progress streaming
   - external side effects

## Default migration rules

- Put orchestration in `"use workflow"` functions.
- Put side effects, SDK calls, DB calls, HTTP calls, and stream I/O in `"use step"` functions.
- Use `sleep()` only in workflow context.
- Use `createHook()` or `createWebhook()` for external resume points.
- Wrap `start()` and `getRun()` inside `"use step"` functions for child runs.
- Use `getStepMetadata().stepId` as the idempotency key for external writes.
- Use `getWritable()` in workflow context to obtain the stream, but interact with it (write, close) only inside `"use step"` functions.
- Prefer rollback stacks for multi-step compensation.
- When the target framework is unspecified, keep route examples framework-agnostic with `Request` / `Response`. Do not default to Next.js-only handler signatures.

## Source references

- Temporal -> `references/temporal.md`
- Inngest -> `references/inngest.md`
- AWS Step Functions -> `references/aws-step-functions.md`

## Shared references

- `references/shared-patterns.md` — reusable code templates for hooks, child workflows, idempotency, streaming, and rollback.
- `references/runtime-targets.md` — Vercel-managed vs custom `World` guidance.

## Required output shape

Return the migration in this structure:

```md
## Migration Plan
## Source -> Target Mapping
## Migrated Code
## App Boundary / Resume Endpoints
## Verification Checklist
## Open Questions
```

## Verification checklist

Fail the draft if any of these are true:

- [ ] Source-framework primitives remain in the migrated code
- [ ] Side effects remain in workflow context
- [ ] `sleep()` appears inside a step
- [ ] Stream interaction (`getWriter()`, `write()`, `close()`) appears inside a workflow function
- [ ] Child workflows call `start()` / `getRun()` directly from workflow context
- [ ] External writes omit idempotency keys
- [ ] Hooks/webhooks are missing where the source used signals, waitForEvent, or task tokens

## Sample prompt

```
Migrate this Inngest workflow to Vercel Workflow.
It uses step.waitForEvent() with a timeout and step.realtime.publish().
```

Expected response shape:
